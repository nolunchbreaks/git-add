            <h2>Biography</h2>

            <h2>Why I Joined ALT School Africa</h2>
            <p>I joined ALT School Africa to become a software engineer because I have a deep passion for technology and its potential to change lives. 
                This career change will not only allow me to pursue my interests but also provide the means to afford my children's university tuition in the future.I have three Children and their names are Danika, Kellon, and Kinglsey
                My children mean everything to me—Danika, my firstborn, came into my life when I was just 22, fresh out of university, followed by Kellon at 24, and then Kingsley at 29. Each of them has been a precious gift, shaping my life in ways I could never have imagined. Lethbridge, Alberta, my hometown, is where my heart truly belongs; it’s where I grew up, and it’s the place I want my children to cherish as much as I do.

Pursuing a career as a DevOps engineer is not just about personal achievement for me; it’s about creating a stable and promising future for my kids. I want to give them the opportunities I didn’t have and show them the value of hard work and dedication. My mother’s love and prayers have been my foundation through it all, keeping me alive and guiding me through the darkest times.

As a pastor at RCCG Canada and the Recovery Church Movement Canada, my mission is to serve others, but my greatest responsibility and joy will always be raising my children with the love and support they need. Everything I do is to ensure they grow up knowing they are loved, supported, and guided in faith and life.
